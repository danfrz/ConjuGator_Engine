ConjuGator_Engine
=================

A flexible abstract engine for verb conjugation and noun declension algorithms
It's currently in development by me, but not very actively.

I'm only studying and creating this as a fun project, and not strictly for any other reason, I am not a linguistics student outside of four years of spanish classes so some of the structural descisions may not be optimal.
